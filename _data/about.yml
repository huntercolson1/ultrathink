tagline: Medical student, engineer, AI enthusiast.
bio: |
  I'm a second-year medical student at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. I studied chemical engineering here at UK for undergrad, and somewhere along the way, I found myself diving deeper into AI, especially where it intersects with medicine. I built this site to share thoughts on tech, medicine, and whatever else I'm into at the moment—and hopefully to put together some tutorials or educational content along the way.
