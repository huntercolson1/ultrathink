title: Hey, I'm Hunter.
tagline: Medical student, engineer, AI enthusiast.
bio: |
  I'm a second-year medical student at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. I studied chemical engineering here at UK for undergrad, and somewhere along the way, I found myself diving deeper into AI, especially where it intersects with medicine. I built this site to share thoughts on tech, medicine, and whatever else I'm into at the moment—and hopefully to put together some tutorials or educational content along the way.

  projects:
    - Developing an AI-driven medical education platform for Socratic tutoring and USMLE-style question generation based on uploaded material.
    - Conducting a clinical trial aimed at improving surgical outcomes for women undergoing reconstructive breast surgery after mastectomy, using LiDAR scanning and photogrammetry to objectively analyze breast shape and volume.
    - Investigating new diagnostic metrics from hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA) to improve the evaluation of gallbladder dysfunction beyond traditional ejection fraction thresholds.
