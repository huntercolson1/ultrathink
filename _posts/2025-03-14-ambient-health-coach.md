Not every patient wants a glowing screen prescribing their next move. During a rehab pilot we tested an ambient health coach that whispers micro-prompts through bedside speakers and wearable haptics. The aim: encourage stretching, hydration, and breathing exercises without breaking the mood of the room.

We discovered three design anchors:

1. **Context awareness over frequency.** Patients respond better when nudges align with natural transitions—post-therapy cooldowns, shift change, or visitor departure.
2. **Voice as material.** We recorded scripts with clinicians who already knew the patients. Familiar voices increased adherence by 18%.
3. **Radical transparency.** Every prompt is logged, and patients can query "why now?" via a quick voice command or wrist tap. Trust grew when they could audit the system.

Over the next quarter we are experimenting with personalized music cues that fade into prompts. If you have ideas for blending soundscapes with behavior science, I would love to hear them.
