We run downtime drills four times a year. It is the only way to guarantee that both humans and systems respond gracefully when the unexpected happens. This winter we finally codified the playbook so new clinics can replicate the cadence without reinventing the wheel.

The playbook covers:

- **Scenario design.** Start with failure modes that already happened nearby—power outages, ransomware alerts, network segmentation errors—and turn them into narrative briefs.
- **Roles and rituals.** Assign scribes, runners, and decision captains. Every role has a laminated card with steps and escalation thresholds.
- **Post-mortem loops.** Within 48 hours we synthesize the logs, highlight friction points, and convert them into backlog tickets or policy tweaks.

Our biggest lesson: drills should feel like storytelling, not punishment. When teams see them as collective practice, they surface creative workarounds we would never design in isolation. The best resilience work is communal.
