Capture happens on an iPad Pro with Pencil, synced to Craft every night. Processing lives inside an Obsidian vault with a monochrome custom theme and annotated graph views. Output ships as static exports with serverless webhooks so analytics never miss a beat.

### Control the capture

- Smart templates prevent blank-screen paralysis.
- Physical checklist in the kit enforces the same ritual each time.

### Protect the processing lane

- Weekly reviews prune vault noise.
- Queries and dashboards are versioned like code.

### Keep the output inevitable

- A publishing cadence keeps briefs under 48 hours.
- Each artifact points back to raw sources for verification.
