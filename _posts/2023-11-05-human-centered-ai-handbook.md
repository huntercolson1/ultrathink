When national regulators publish new guardrails for AI in healthcare, independent clinics often see a wall of jargon instead of actionable steps. Over the last quarter I facilitated workshops with six primary care groups to co-create a handbook that makes those rules tangible.

We focused on three pillars: data stewardship, staff literacy, and escalation paths. For each pillar we mapped the regulation to a single-page checklist that clinic managers can print, annotate, and revisit. Every section ends with a "table talk" prompt to encourage cross-role dialogue—because adopting AI safely is cultural before it is technical.

The handbook is licensed under Creative Commons to encourage remixing. Next iteration we are building a lightweight auditing companion that automatically generates documentation from the checklists. Feedback welcome, especially from rural practices that navigate resource constraints the rest of us rarely feel.
