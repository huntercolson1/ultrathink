Spending twelve months rotating between oncology, emergency medicine, and community clinics gave me a zoomed-out view of how systems either empower or frustrate patient care. I carried a sketchbook and recorded every workflow interruption I witnessed. Those sketches became catalysts for conversations with nurses, admissions coordinators, and IT staff alike.

The most persistent pattern was **context collapse**. Clinicians got flooded with data points devoid of priority or story. When I prototyped a daily briefing sheet that grouped labs by *expected vs. unexpected*, the adoption rate spiked, and handoffs suddenly felt calmer. It was a reminder that design is translation, not decoration.

That year also reshaped my relationship with metrics. Response times and reorder rates were useful, but the anecdotes about reclaimed time mattered more. In future builds I plan to pair analytics dashboards with narrative logging tools so teams can capture their own before-and-after snapshots. Data only earns trust when people see themselves reflected in it.
